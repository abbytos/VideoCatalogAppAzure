- **Responsive Design:** Supports a responsive front-end design across various screen widths.
- **Error Handling:** Properly handles file upload errors and size restrictions.
- **Web API:** Includes an ASP.NET Core Web API for handling file uploads.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 6 MVC:** Backend framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern in .NET.
- **C#:** Primary programming language for backend development in the .NET ecosystem.
- **HTML, CSS:** Front-end technologies for creating the user interface and adding interactivity to web pages.
- **KnockoutJS:** JavaScript library for implementing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, enabling dynamic UI updates and data binding.
